## Technologies used

### Backend

- TMBD API

Fetching data from the  [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) to display items infos and locate youtube trailers.

- Heroku, GIT & PostgreSql

The project is deployed and hosted on Heroku, utilizing the PostgreSQL add-on for database management. It is linked to my github repository for coninuous deployment.

- PHP

For server-side scripting and handling user authentication.

- Composer

Used to manage PHP dependencies, facilitating deployment on Heroku.

### Frontend

- HTML/CSS/JS

For structuring, styling, and adding interactivity to the website. JS also handles asynchronous requests.

This file manages the database connection, utilizing PHPâ€™s PDO extension to interact with the PostgreSQL database. It ensures secure and efficient database operations throughout the project.

- `home.php`

The home page of the Getflix project, where users can view available trailers. It serves as the main landing page after successful login.

## What I've learned.

One should not underestimate PHP deployment on Heroku. Migrating from the local environment to the remote one got me a few more white hairs on my head. I know understand better the concept of SQL database & environment variable.
